	part 1 of the vendis bug fix:
	- requirements wasn't specified
	- defaultlogin was incorrect
	- according to INSTALL inc.config.php was in base, not in inc subdir
	- some mysql statements was missing database selection
	- removed <> around examples in inc/inc.config.php to easen editing.
	- removed CR (\015) from several files.

	* inc/inc.init.php, modules/maintenance/update_scratch.php,
	tools/update_scratch.pl, update_scratch.php, update_scratch.pl:
	- mitigated SQL injection attacks by
		- sanitizing input
		- moved permit/deny logic outside of the SELECT statement
	- moved update_scratch.php to modules/maintenance, and re-enabled login check
	- tools/update_scratch.pl is to be used for cron(1m) updates instead

	* modules/search/search.php, peep.php:
	as pointed out by Fredrik Hesse, deal with possible XSS attack, by munging all
	syslog messages to be displayed thru htmlentities().

	* update_scratch.php, update_scratch.pl:
	update_scratch.php: update_scratch.php is replaced with a perl version
	specifically written for cron jobs, re-enable requirement to login on
	the PHP version, so we can use it within aspect.

	update_scratch.pl: rewrote update_scratch.php in perl, to be used outside
	of the docroot for cron jobs.

	* about.php, aspect.css, image.php, inc.config.php,
	inc.footer.php, inc.header.php, inc.init.php, index.php,
	loginpage.php, peep.php, script.js, sql.php:
	Rewrote the concept from using tables into using real time generated images.
	The bad thing is that this tools now requires GD lib for PHP. :)
