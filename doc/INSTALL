-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Requirements

aspect requires the following in terms of software:

- Apache v1 or v2
- PHP4
- The GD module for PHP4 (php4-gd)
- MySQL v4 (v3 works but with less functionality)
- A syslog daemon capable of feeding MySQL such as msyslogd or syslog-ng

2. Configure and install msyslog

Grab latest version of msyslog from sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/msyslog/),
we have been using version 1.08g rather extensively and it works well on Linux.

Create a directory for msyslog (optional), if not, default install
points to /usr/local, which might be fine for some sites.

# mkdir /opt/msyslog-X.XX
# ln -s /opt/msyslog-X.XX /opt/msyslog

Unpack, configure, compile and install msyslog

# tar zxvf msyslog-vX.XX-src.tar.gz
# cd msyslog-vX.XX
# ./configure --prefix=/opt/msyslog
# make
# make install

3. Configure /etc/syslog.conf

msyslogd doesn't cope to well with recent extensions to the syslog.conf file format,
hence you will need to "correct" lines with backslashes (\) as a line separator
to lines without it, e.g.:

*.debug; \
  auth,authpriv.none; \
  news.none;mail.none	/var/log/debug

needs to replaced/converted to

*.debug;auth,authpriv.none;news.none;mail.none  /var/log/debug

and as always when dealing with syslog.conf, be careful to keep at least one <TAB>
separating <selector> and <action>, e.g.:

mail.info<TAB>/var/log/mail.info

since most syslog implementations will not accept space as a field separator
between <selector> and <action>.

finally add an entry at the end to feed all facilities and priorities into
the syslog table we are creating in the next section.

*.*		%mysql -s localhost -u <user> -p <password> -d <db> -t <table> -D -F -P

The -D is to enable DELAYED INSERTS and -F and -P tells msyslog to also log the
facility and priority of the initial syslog message to the database table.

4. Prefilter logs (optional)

If you have an extreme amount of logs, you might choose to pre-filter what get's
stored to the MySQL table, to reduce the amount of clutter when viewing the logs
with aspect.

E.g. we might have a couple of routers and firewalls doing ACCEPT logs and generating
a tremendous amount of log entries which we really aren't all that interested in
by the means of aspect (since we usually want to see anomalies and not that a mail
just got dropped of to someone, or that my PIX just allowed someone to issue a DNS
query to my DNS server)

Fortunately, msyslog has a regex module which fits perfectly for this, simply prefilter
out patterns you do not want to clutter the SQL logs with by inserting regex lines
and using the -v (reverse result) option combined with either the -m (match exp in message)
or -h (match exp in host), -d (match exp in date) or -t (match exp in time)

(NB: msyslogd needs a patch to get the -v option to work, else it will coredump.
for a patch, see patches/msyslogd.diff)

E.g.:

local0.* %regex -v -m [.*permitted.*|patt|patt] %mysql -s localhost -u <user> -p <password> -d <db> -t <table> -D -F -P
local1.* %regex -v -m [pattern|pattern]         %mysql -s localhost -u <user> -p <password> -d <db> -t <table> -D -F -P
*.*;local0,local1.none                          %mysql -s localhost -u <user> -p <password> -d <db> -t <table> -D -F -P

Above example would remove any messages at the facility local0 or local1 matching the specified
patterns in received syslog messages, due to the use of the -v option.

5. Configure MySQL

   a. Create a database for syslog

   # mysql -u root -p
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE syslog;
   Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

   b. Create the tables needed by aspect

   # mysql -u root -p syslog <structure.sql

   c. Create the two users aspect needs and a user for msyslogd

   # mysql -u root -p
   mysql> GRANT SELECT ON syslog.* TO 'search'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-random-password';
   mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON syslog.scratch TO 'search'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-random-password';
   mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON syslog.queries TO 'search'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-random-password';
   mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON syslog.* TO 'aspect'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-random-password';
   mysql> GRANT INSERT ON syslog.syslog TO 'syslog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-random-password';

   d. Preload saved SQL queries (optional)

   # mysql -u root -p syslog <aspect-data.sql

6. Modify /etc/init.d/sysklogd

Modify /etc/init.d/sysklogd to start msyslog instead of the your old syslogd, usually is
a one-liner, e.g. from Debian unstable:

replace

binpath=/sbin/syslogd

with

binpath=/opt/msyslog/sbin/syslogd (or /usr/local/sbin/syslogd, depending on your install
prefix earlier)

7. Restart syslogd and possibly klogd

Usually klogd needs to be started after syslogd, so to make sure we don't loose any
kernel logs we will restart it as well.

# /etc/init.d/sysklogd restart
# /etc/init.d/klogd restart

8. Install aspect

Create a new documentroot (optional) or a subdirectory of an existing document root
and unpack the aspect ball of tar in it.

# cd /var/www
# tar zxvf aspect-X.XX.tgz
# mv aspect-X.XX aspect.example.se

Correct permissions and owner/group on files and subdirectories

# chown -R root:root aspect.example.se
# chmod -R a-w aspect.example.se
# find aspect.example.se -type d -exec chmod 555 {} \;

9. Configure aspect

You will need to tell aspect which MySQL users it should use, their respective
passwords, host that runs the MySQL server and which database to use.

aspect keeps this information in a file called "inc.config.php", change directory
into the location where aspect was installed and fire up your favourite editor (can
i hear vim? :) and change the below fields accordingly.

# cd /var/www/aspect
# vi inc/inc.config.php

/* Syslog database settings */
$syslogHost = "localhost";
$syslogUser = "aspect";
$syslogPass = "some-random-password";
$syslogDatabase = "syslog";

/* Syslog database settings for the searchpage */
$syslogSearchHost = "localhost";
$syslogSearchUser = "search";
$syslogSearchPass = "some-random-password";
$syslogSearchDatabase = "syslog";

10. Configure Apache

Rather straightforward and nothing fancy, ie something similar to:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName aspect.example.se
    ServerAdmin mosthamster@example.se
    DocumentRoot /var/www/aspect.example.se

    ServerSignature Off

    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/aspect.example.se/error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/aspect.example.se/access.log combined
    .
    .

    Redirect / https://aspect.example.se
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName aspect.example.se
    ServerAdmin mosthamster@example.se
    DocumentRoot /var/www/aspect.example.se

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile    /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key

    ServerSignature Off

    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/aspect.example.se/error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/aspect.example.se/access.log combined

    .
	.

</VirtualHost>

11. Create filter rules thru/with the Web UI

Fire up your favourite web browser, and point it at http://aspect.example.se,
you should get redirected to the SSL site and see the aspect login screen.

Login with user admin and password "password" (original huh? :) you will
however be forced to change the admin password after the initial login.

12. Bugs, Bugs?, BUGS!?

Please use sourceforge's bug tracker to submit bug reports for aspect (or even
better, drop us a well formatted unidiff fixing the problem :)

Questions can be directed to either froo (at) users.sourceforge.net or
